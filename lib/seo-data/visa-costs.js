      ### Official 2026 Policy Overview
      The Thai government has recognized India as one of its most critical source markets for tourism. As a result, the visa policies for Indian passport holders are incredibly favorable and frequently updated to encourage travel.
      
      **Current Options for Indian Citizens:**
      1. **Temporary Visa Exemption:** Periodically, Thailand announces periods where Indian citizens can enter completely visa-free for up to 30 days. Always check the Royal Thai Embassy website for current active dates.
      2. **Visa on Arrival (VoA):** If exemption is not active, Indian citizens can utilize VoA at major international airports (BKK, DMK, HKT, CNX) for tourism purposes up to 15 days.
      3. **E-Visa (Recommended):** The official Thai E-Visa portal allows you to secure your entry prior to departure, completely bypassing airport queues.
    `,
        pricingOverview: `
      ### Visa Fees and Financial Requirements
      - **Visa Exemption:** Free.
      - **Visa on Arrival Fee:** Typically 2,000 THB (approx. â‚¹4,700 INR). Must be paid in cash in Thai Baht at the airport counter.
      - **Proof of Funds:** Regardless of the visa type (even if it's free), Thai immigration requires arriving Indian tourists to prove they have adequate finances. You must carry either 10,000 THB per person or 20,000 THB per family (or the equivalent in USD/INR).

      ### How to Secure Your Visa on Arrival (VoA) Step-by-Step
      **Step 1: Preparation in India**
      Print your confirmed return flight ticket (must be within 15 days of arrival). Print your confirmed hotel booking covering the entire stay. Carry exactly 2,000 THB per person (exchange this in India before you fly). Carry two recent 4x6cm passport photos. Fill out the TM.88 application form (available online) beforehand.
      
      **Step 2: Arrival at Suvarnabhumi (BKK)**
      Follow the signs for "Visa on Arrival" before you reach the main immigration hall. Do not go to the regular passport control queue yet.
      
      **Step 3: The Document Check**
      Present your passport (valid for 6 months), TM.88 form, photos, return flight, hotel booking, and 2,000 THB fee. You may be asked to show your 10,000 THB proof of funds.
      
      **Step 4: Visa Issuance and Immigration**
      Collect your passport with the new visa stamp, then proceed through the VoA specific immigration lane right next to the counters. Retrieve your baggage.

      ## The Gateway to Southeast Asia
      Navigating the Thailand Visa for Indian citizens is the first step to your holiday, and thankfully, it is one of the most streamlined processes in the world. Thailand has heavily invested in infrastructure to ensure Indian tourists flow into the country efficiently.

      ### The Case for the E-Visa
      While the Visa on Arrival (VoA) is incredibly convenient, if your flight from India lands during peak hours (e.g., midnight when multiple flights from Delhi, Mumbai, and China arrive simultaneously), the VoA queue can easily surpass two hours. For families or those seeking immediate relaxation, applying for the E-Visa (or the fast-track E-VoA depending on current systems) before you leave India is highly recommended. It turns a chaotic arrival into a five-minute breeze.

      ### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
      1. **Blank Return Tickets:** Thai immigration strictly enforces the return ticket rule. A one-way ticket from India will result in denied boarding by your airline.
      2. **Digital Hotel Bookings:** Never rely on showing a PDF on your phone. If your phone dies or you have no internet at immigration, you face massive delays. Always carry physical printouts of your Agoda/Booking.com confirmations.
      3. **Damaged Passports:** Thai immigration is notoriously strict regarding passport condition. If your Indian passport is water-damaged, torn, or severely frayed, renew it before attempting to enter Thailand.

            { question: 'Do I really need to carry 10,000 THB in cash?', answer: 'Yes. While they do not check every single passenger, spot checks are extremely common. If they ask to see your funds and you cannot produce 10,000 THB (or equivalent in USD/INR), you can be legally deported on the next flight.' }

      ## The Most Affordable International Holiday
      Understanding the Thailand trip cost from India is crucial for planning because the sheer variety of options in Thailand means you can spend as little, or as much, as you desire. Thailand is globally unique because it simultaneously caters to 19-year-old backpackers carrying rucksacks and billionaires docking superyachts.

      ### The Flight Advantage
      The primary reason Thailand trips are so affordable for Indians is the proximity and flight volume. With over 100 direct flights a week connecting Indian tier-1 and tier-2 cities directly to Bangkok and Phuket, airline competition is fierce. If you are flexible with your dates and avoid Diwali or Christmas weeks, scoring â‚¹12,000 round-trip tickets is completely normal.

      ### Where India Pays a Premium
      The only area where Indian tourists typically spend more than expected is on Indian food. Authentic Indian restaurants in Bangkok and Pattaya must import spices and chefs, making them significantly more expensive than eating local Thai street food. If you are on a strict budget, eating local is mandatory. If you must have Paneer Tikka every night, increase your food budget by 40%.

      ### Shopping Budget
      Do not forget to budget for shopping. The sheer volume of electronics, clothing, and cosmetics available at MBK, Platinum Fashion Mall, and Chatuchak is intoxicating. Most Indian travelers arrive with half-empty suitcases and spend anywhere from â‚¹10,000 to â‚¹50,000 purely on retail.

        faqs: [
            { question: 'Is Thailand cheaper than a domestic trip in India?', answer: 'Surprisingly, yes. Because Thailand has such a massive hotel infrastructure, a 4-star hotel in Bangkok is often significantly cheaper than a 4-star hotel in Goa or Mumbai during peak seasons.' },
            { question: 'Can I manage a trip under â‚¹30,000 from India?', answer: 'Yes, if you book flights during sales, stay in clean 3-star hotels or premium hostels, utilize the Skytrain, and eat purely delicious local Thai street food.' },
            { question: 'Which city is the most expensive in Thailand?', answer: 'Phuket is universally the most expensive destination in Thailand due to its island logistics and massive western tourist demand. Bangkok and Pattaya are significantly cheaper.' }

      ### Official 2026 Policy Overview
      Unlike many western or ASEAN nations, travelers holding a Nepalese passport do not qualify for Visa Exemption or Visa on Arrival (VoA) in Thailand. You MUST obtain a visa prior to boarding your flight.
      
      **The Single Entry Tourist Visa (TR):**
      - **Duration:** Grants a maximum stay of 60 days in Thailand.
      - **Where to Apply:** All applications must be submitted to the Royal Thai Embassy or officially authorized VFS/Visa Application Centers located in Kathmandu.
      - **Who Can Apply:** You can apply individually, or authorize a registered travel agency within Nepal to process the documents on your behalf.

        pricingOverview: `
      ### Visa Application Costs (Nepal)
      - **Official Embassy Fee:** Approximately NPR 5,000 to NPR 6,000 (Subject to slight exchange rate fluctuations).
      - **Agency Processing Fee:** If using a travel agent in Kathmandu or Pokhara to handle the logistics, expect to pay an additional NPR 1,500 to NPR 3,000 for their service/courier.

      ### Step-by-Step Visa Application Process in Nepal
      **Step 1: Gather Mandatory Documents**
      You must possess an original Nepalese passport (at least 6 months validity with blank pages). You need a completely filled application form and two recent color photographs (3.5 x 4.5 cm, white background, no glasses).
      
      **Step 2: Secure Flight and Hotel Proofs**
      The embassy requires absolute proof of your travel intent. You must present a confirmed round-trip flight ticket from KTM to BKK, and a fully confirmed hotel reservation covering your entire duration of stay in Thailand.
      
      **Step 3: Financial Verification**
      Perhaps the most critical step. You must submit an original bank statement showing recent transactions for the past 6 months, possessing a minimum balance equivalent to USD $1,000 per individual (or USD $2,000 per family). It must be officially stamped by your bank in Nepal.
      
      **Step 4: Submission and Wait**
      Submit your dossier to the embassy or visa center in Kathmandu. The standard processing time is approximately 5 to 7 working days, but can take longer during peak holidays (like Dashain or Thai Songkran). Do not book non-refundable tickets close to the application date.

      ## Navigating Thai Bureaucracy from Nepal
      Securing a Thailand Visa for Nepali citizens requires planning. Because Visa on Arrival is not an option, spontaneous, last-minute flights to Bangkok are generally impossible. Understanding the exact requirements of the Royal Thai Embassy in Kathmandu is critical to ensuring your holiday goes perfectly.

      ### The Importance of the Bank Statement
      The primary reason for visa rejections out of Nepal is insufficient or inconsistent financial documentation. The Thai embassy wants to ensure you are a genuine tourist with the financial means to support yourself, rather than someone seeking illegal employment. Your bank statement should show a healthy, consistent history, not just a sudden deposit of NPR 150,000 the day before printing the statement.

      ### Using a Travel Agency
      Because compiling the paperwork and visiting the embassy in Kathmandu can be time-consuming (especially if you live in Pokhara, Birgunj, or outside the valley), utilizing a reputable travel agency is highly recommended. For a small fee, they scrub your application for errors before submission, drastically reducing the chance of rejection.
