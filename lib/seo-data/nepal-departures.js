      ## The Perfect Escape from Kathmandu
      Trading the majestic peaks and cooler climate of the Kathmandu Valley for the tropical golden sands of Thailand is a dream for many Nepalese travelers. Thailand offers an incredibly accessible and affordable international holiday destination with a starkly different landscape, culture, and climate.

      Our Thailand tour packages from Kathmandu are specifically designed to cater to the preferences of Nepalese tourists, focusing heavily on vibrant shopping districts in Bangkok and the thrilling beach experiences of Pattaya and Phuket.

      ### Direct Connectivity from Tribhuvan International
      With regular direct flights operating daily between Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM) and both Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports in Bangkok, travel is smooth and takes roughly 3.5 hours. Airlines like Thai Airways, Thai Lion Air, and Nepal Airlines make this route incredibly convenient.

      ### A Shopping Paradise for Nepalese Travelers
      We understand that shopping is a major highlight for Nepalese visiting Thailand. Instead of staying far from the city center, our customized Kathmandu departure packages strategically place you in hotels directly adjacent to Pratunam Market, Platinum Fashion Mall, and Siam Paragon. This ensures you have maximum time to explore, negotiate, and shop without wasting time in Bangkok traffic.

      ### The Contrast of the Ocean
      For residents of the landlocked Himalayas, the pristine beaches of Southern Thailand are breathtaking. Our packages ensure seamless, comfortable logistical transfers from the megacity of Bangkok down to the serene, crystal waters of the Gulf of Thailand or the Andaman Sea.
